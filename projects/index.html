                    Using an <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/">RTL-SDR</a>, a USB device that receives radio waves, I
                    was able to receive and decode signals sent from the NOAA
                    and METEOR weather satellites and produce images. I had to
                    build a special antenna specifically tuned to the
                    satellites' frequencies. After doing everything manually, I
                    moved to automating the process. I wrote my own software to
                    record and decode the satellites as they passed overhead,
                    then post them on my website. I also made an app to decode
                    images on my phone.

                <p>
                    In one of my previous projects, I made a smart desk lamp that could be turned on and off using google assistant. But
                    since I am lazy, I would rather my light turn on by itself when I walk into my room. So, I bought a passive infrared
                    (PIR) sensor. These sensors are able to detect movement, and are often used in buildings to turn on lights once someone
                    walks in. I connected this PIR sensor to my raspberry pi, which was also connected to 5v relay to control my light. Now,
                    my raspberry pi was the "brains" that could toggle my light depending on if there is movement in my room. After writing
                    a python program that would run on the raspberry pi, my light could turn on the moment I walked into my room and turn
                    off once 10 minutes passed without movement. Since the raspberry pi is also connected to the internet, I made it so I
                    could toggle my light manually from my phone.

                    I built this website completely from scratch, meaning I
                    wrote almost every line of code. It started a while ago when
                    I purchased the <a href="https://felixperron.ca">felixperron.ca</a> domain name when I saw a
                    cheap deal online. I didn't really have a use for it yet,
                    but I hoped to use it to display what I had accomplished
                    online. Now, not only is it serving its purpose, but I have
                    learned many things making it. It can also be incorporated
                    into my other projects to add a web aspect to them, like I
                    did with my automated satellite receiving project.

                    Using Javascript and HTML, I created a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers. I think I was
                    able to make the code compact and efficient.

                    In programming class, I made a weather website in my free time. It tries to get your location using the computer's IP
                    address and shows the weather for that location. I the location is wrong you can also search for another city.
